I was born in New York Moved and to Greenwich Connecticut where I attended highschool. I begin my college career at Fairfield university initiallay as a mechanical engineer, where I also played division one rugby. I realized I prefer the thinking style of physics during my second semester and made the switch. I also decided to transfer to University of Connecticut which ranks among the top thirty public univeristies in the country for Physics to continue my education.
